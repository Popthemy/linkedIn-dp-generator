# 🎨 Event DP Generator

A **dynamic and reusable profile picture (DP) generator** built with **React**, designed to give event attendees a personalized way to showcase their participation.

This project was first built for **LinkedIn Local Lagos – October 4th**, using a creative template designed by the **LinkedIn Local Lagos Creative Team**. All credit for the template design goes to them. I simply developed the **code logic** that powers the interactivity. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Image Upload** – attendees can upload their photo to personalize their DP.
- ✍️ **Custom Name & Nickname** – add your details with flexible font size controls.
- 🎯 **Fixed Positioning** – names, nicknames, and images are rendered in precise positions on the event template.
- 🔄 **Reusable Across Events** – simply swap out the background template, and this generator can be used for **any event, brand, or community gathering**.
- 📂 **Export in High Quality** – download your generated DP in **PDF format** for crisp, print-ready output.
- ⚡ **React-Powered** – fast, responsive, and lightweight.
